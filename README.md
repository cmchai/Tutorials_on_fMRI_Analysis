# Tutorials_on_fMRI_Analysis
This is the repository to store and update the Jupyter Notebooks that I created to faciliate the teaching on advanced fMRI data analysis at Ghent University

## Objective of this repository

functional MRI (fMRI) analysis can be complex and difficult to navigate without systematic support. This is particular challenging for students since they lack the resources, both in terms of software, such as Matlab license and hardware, such as high performance computer. Thanks to previous effort to illustrate fMRI analysis in Python environment, such as the high quality teach materials by Lukas Snoek \([ni-edu](https://lukas-snoek.com/NI-edu/)\), and Luke Chang \([DartBrains](https://dartbrains.org/content/Instructors.html)\).
