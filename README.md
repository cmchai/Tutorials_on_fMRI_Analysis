# Tutorials_on_fMRI_Analysis
This is the repository to store and update the Jupyter Notebooks that I created to faciliate the teaching on advanced fMRI data analysis at Ghent University

## Objective of this repository

functional MRI (fMRI) analysis can be complex and difficult to navigate without systematic support. This is particular challenging for students since they lack the resources, both in terms of software, such as Matlab license and hardware, such as high performance computer. Thanks to previous effort to illustrate fMRI analysis in Python environment, such as the high quality teach materials by Lukas Snoek \([ni-edu](https://lukas-snoek.com/NI-edu/)\), and Luke Chang \([DartBrains](https://dartbrains.org/content/Instructors.html)\), running some analysis by students themselves became more feasible and manageable.

Inspired by these great learning resources, I have created teaching materials in Juputer Notebook that focus on how to leverage on the fMRI dataset that are publicly available, and use these dataset to practice on fMRI analysis. These teaching materials were created to facilitate the Master-level courses, including *Case Studies in the Analysis of Experimental Data* and *Technical Foundations of Data Analysis in Experimental Psychology and Cognitive Neuroscience* from Ghent University.

## Structure of the repository 
So far, this repository included two notebooks. the first notebook focused on how to find a fMRI open dataset online, and how to download them into one's local pc, and do some basic check on the data and visualize them via some simple plotting functions.

The second notebook gives detailed instruction and explanations on how to analyse pre-processed fMRI data for one participant, such as spatial smoothing, creating predictor matrix and GLM model fitting etc. This notebook covers the classic GLM modeling approach on fMRI data to investigate which brain region\(s)\ are highly activated in a certain experimental condition compared to another experimental condition.

In the future, more notebooks will be added, covering topics such as group-level statistical inference and more advanced methods, such as neural decoding and representational similarity analysis.

## Bugs and improvement
if you run into issues when openning or running these notebooks, or your think something can be improved, please contact the author \(chaimengqiao@\[gmail\].com\).
